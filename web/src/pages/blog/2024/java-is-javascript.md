# Java is actually quite like JavaScript.

## Conventional Wisdom

Conventional wisdom dictates that "java is to javascript what ham is to hamster"

And while this sounds catchy and allows java dev's to distance themselves from the "mess" of javascript I believe it's also a lie.

Java and JavaScript share very similar problems.

In this blog post I'll give 3 excrutiating similarities between the two ecosystems and how they are the bane of my coding career.
The dirty secret of Java is that it's the original JavaScript, the original language used where it shouldn't of been. It's almost
entirely a marketing ploy that either of these languages are considered to be the default.

Most controvertially of all, at the end I'll make the point that JavaScript is a better ecosystem then Java and will soon out perform it in key metrics.

> note: My bias here would be in favour of Java and the JVM given I'm a Scala developer.

## Similarity 1: Package Management and Build Ecosystem

Long before Rollup, Grunt, Gulp, and Webpack. Java had Make, Buildr, Maven, Gradle, and Ant.
I bring these into the conversation as an example that despite the feeling java has "one way to do things" that's rarely the case. Even at my place of work I've moved across several projects and been subjected to 3 different ways to build my JVM based projects. That's somehow worse then when I was working in JavaScript.
