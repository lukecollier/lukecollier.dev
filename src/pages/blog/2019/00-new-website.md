Why, what, when and where? 
It came to my attention my open source contributions are lacking, this website is the first step on my goal of becoming a contributor.

## Welcome!

After many months faffing around with react, reasonml, elm and various other technologies I finally found one that works well for me!

Hello [Zola!](https://www.getzola.org/)

Zola is perfect for my needs paired with my new favourite CSS toy; [atomizer](https://acss.io/) I've got all I need to spec out and build a robust full featured blog to share my thoughts and _insights_.

Not just a blog I can create a beautiful page for my cv aswell!

Over the next year I'll be writing blog posts and slowly updating my website. 

## Why
A place to vent, and write down my thoughts about the world of tech. As well as talk about upcoming, current and completed projects.

## Technology
I've thoroughly enjoyed my experience making this website Zola is a dream with fast feedback, hot reloading, no abstraction pages and solid templating the experience has been a joy!
