With a wealth of experience I am fluent in self management, architecture and development. I am keen to work together with others to produce a quality, sustainable product. My passion lies with finding solutions in interesting domains, specifically improving scaling code into the future.

## Timeline

| Syntax      | Description           |         |     |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------- | --- |
| 2022 - Now | Senior Scala Engineer | Skedulo | With Skedulo I went back to my routes, working with NP-hard problems, integrating with third parties to optimise schedules for massive problem spaces. Being instrumental in implementing the teams ways of working and performing large migrations on the teams code base. While at Skedulo I pushed for, implemented, and thrived with Kanban. |
| 2021 - 2022 | Senior Scala Engineer | OrgVue | While working at OrgVue I spent time helping with the release pipelines and improving the developer experience. By working with our operations team I was able to help shape the engineering vision for the coming years. A major achievement includes getting all engineers access to our cloud resources enabling us to debug and deploy frequently. |
| 2019 - 2021 | Scala Engineer | Disney Streaming Services | While at Disney Streaming Services I furthered my understanding of a/b testing and helped develop a completely new experimentation service written entirely in functional Scala with a Postgres database. The service handled millions of requests daily with extremely low latency requirements (in the less than 50 millisecond range). |
| 2017 - 2019 | Software Engineer | Booking.com | During my time at booking I worked on an advanced a/b tested website with over one hundred concurrent experiments ran daily and thousands of users per minute. This gave me the confidence to make changes, monitor releases and respond to outages. As an engineer I was responsible for maintaining, fixing and releasing new features to the website working across a Spring Javascript stack. I spent time on multiple projects including pricing, SEO, insurance and an optimisation team. |
| 2014 - 2017 | BSC First with Honours in Computer Science | Bangor University | While at university my dissertation was on Genetic Algorithms, with research into various machine learning algorithms. I created a project that would take a data set and provide an optimized time table based on a fitness function. |

## Experience

* **Innovative & Eager to learn -** When moving to Disney Streaming Services we made the choice to use a new effect library, to help my understanding I built out a web applications in my own time to fully understand the benefits and provide a deep understanding of the features available.
* **Working in a Team -** I thrive in a collaborative team environment, this showed while working at Disney Streaming Services I often paired with others to share ZIO and Scala knowledge so we could quickly up-skill members with no previous Scala knowledge. This led to less than two week turn around time for these members to be able to contribute on their own.
* **Continuous Releases -** While working at Disney & Concentra I was crucial in shaping our infrastructure pipeline for minimizing time to release. I strongly believe the ability to move quickly is the key to robust software.

## Interests

* **Recreational Coding -** I have made a tmux session manager in rust I call trust that I use day to day.
* **Photography -** Outside of programming you can find me exploring the British countryside, trying my best to capture a moment.
* **Climbing -** I'm active in the Manchester climbing community, I enjoy the slow methodical planning it takes to action complex sequences to get to complete a route.

## Skills
**Migrations** from **Maven** to **Gradle**, and **Cats Effect 2** to **3**,
Async functional programming in **Scala** with **Cats Effect** or **ZIO**.
**Object** oriented in **Java** with **Spring**,
**Rust** web service development using **Actix** and **Diesel**.
**Agile** doing **XP** and **Scrum** and a huge **Kanban** advocate.
**Postgresql** with **Doobie** with **HikariCP**
Infrastructure as code using **Terraform**.
