# Welcome!

After many months faffing around with react, reasonml, elm and various other technologies I finally found one that works well for me!

Hello [Zola!](https://www.getzola.org/)

Zola is perfect for my needs paired with my new favourite CSS toy; [atomizer](https://acss.io/) I've got all I need to spec out and build a rhobust full featured blog to share my thoughts in an dense space.

Not just a blog I can create a beautiful page for my cv aswell!

Over the next year I'll be writing blog posts and slowly updating my website. 

# Why
A place to vent, and write down my thoughts about the world of tech. As well as talk about upcoming, current and completed projects.
