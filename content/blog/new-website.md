# Welcome!

After many months faffing around with react, reasonml, elm and various other frameworks
I decided none of that met the requirements for a static blog.

# Why not React?

Front end frameworks are in a great space for simplifying complex real time operations react and friends make the experience for applications tighter. But all this has a heavy javascript cost! Something I'm not willing to pay for the obvious choice to me is making web pages and links.
